## üóíÔ∏è **My Learning Journey**

> üí° *‚ÄúAs a beginner, I first built this workflow using only Google Sheets and AI:  
> I collected data with Google Sheets nodes, generated recipes using Gemini AI, saved them to another Google Sheet, and sent them by email.  
> After learning and working hard, I improved it by adding a Webhook and testing it with Postman. Now, my workflow is more flexible and real-world ready!‚Äù*
